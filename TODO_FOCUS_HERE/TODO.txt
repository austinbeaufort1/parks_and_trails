1. red trail at nelson kennedy ledges shows out and back even though it's really just point to point. 
    this is due to the algorithm checking if start and end are close together, if not then it's an out and back.

check if crux angles on cardlist align with crux angles on map

2. Maybe I dont need red points at the end of a trail?

3. Trails sometimes overlap on the map

4. maybe selected trail should glow a bit so it's obvious that one is selected

5. green dots on the map overlap need a solution

new layers, cemeteries, geocaches, custom routes, straight line missions, challenge trails
